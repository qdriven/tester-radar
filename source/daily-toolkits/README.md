# README

This Repo is for daily work productivity improvement.
The Repo includes several scripts for reduce duplicated works in daily life.

Here is some scritps:

- [X] URL_RECORDING
- [X] TO_DO_RECORDING

## URL_RECORDING Why:

Browser favorite is hard to maintain and aslo hard to export in a structured format.
I want to record the urls and usage into a structured format for further usage, for example:

* scrawl the github repos
* make my favorite into a simple static web site
* .......

but I don't want to add the url to favorite and then maintain it again, so I want a little script to do 
the both things. 

## URL_RECORDING What:

A script could record urls in different categories or different files in a json format(structured format).

## URL_RECORDING How:

Features:

* a script could add url,url description into different categories
* a script could maintain the different categories.

## URL_RECORDING The Result:

[favorite.py](favorite/favorite.py) is the solution. Here is the introduction:

```
usage: favorite_cli.py [-h] [-a A] [-l L] [-u U] [-c C] [-d D]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a A        add category name
  -l L        list category names
  -u U        added url
  -c C        category name for url
  -d D        url description

```
