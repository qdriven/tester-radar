Postmodern Testing Manifesto

Software testing is an art and each testing project is a unique work of art. Like the world of art, the testing profession has matured into a postmodern age where the test artisan incorporates prior schools of thought, readily abandons what doesnâ€™t apply, and creatively combines them with innovation specific to the problem at hand, within the constraints at hand.

To that end, when testing, we value:
Creativity
Innovation
Diversity
Sharing
Reuse
